        We will use this paragraph to illustrate several Microsoft Word features. It will be
used to illustrate Space Before, Space After, and line spacing. Space Before tells
Microsoft Word how much space to leave before the paragraph. Space After tells
Microsoft Word how much space to leave after the paragraph. Line Spacing sets the
space between lines within a paragraph.
We will use this paragraph to illustrate some additional more Word features. It
will be used to illustrate first-line indent. With first-line indent, you can indent the first
line of your paragraph. We will also look at Indentation. Indentation enables you to
indent from the left and/or right margins of your document.We will use this paragraph to illustrate several Microsoft Word features. It will be
